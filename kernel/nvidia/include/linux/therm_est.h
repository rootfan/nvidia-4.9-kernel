 * Timer trip provides a way to change trip temp dynamically based on timestamp
 * when the trip is enabled.
 * - Timer trip can be various numbers on a trip.
 * - If the trip is enabled, then timer will be started with time_after delay
 *   in the corresponding timer trip. After the timer expires, trip_temp and
 *   hysteresis in the corresponding timer trip will be used to trip_temp for
 *   the trip.
 * - When the timer has expired, index of timer trip will be increased a step
 *   and then start the timer with time_after delay in newly indexed timer trip.
 * - When temp is below trip temp, index of timer trip will be decreased a step
 *   and then stop the timer and start the timer with time_after delay in newly
 *   indexed timer trip.
 * - The timer will be stopped if there is no more next timer trip on the trip,
 *   or the trip is disabled.
